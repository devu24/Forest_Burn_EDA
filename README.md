# Forest_Burn_EDA

1. Importing Libraries
The first step involves importing the necessary Python libraries, such as:
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy for numerical computations.
matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for data visualization.
sklearn for machine learning tasks like preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
2. Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame using pandas. The file path to the dataset is specified, and the data is loaded using pd.read_csv().
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary Statistics: The .describe() method is used to get the summary statistics of the dataset, which provides information like mean, median, and standard deviation.
Missing Values: The notebook checks for missing values using .isnull().sum() to understand how much data preprocessing is required.
Data Distribution: Visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots are generated using matplotlib and seaborn to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables.
4. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Any missing values are dealt with, either by dropping rows/columns with missing values or by filling them using techniques like mean, median, or mode.
Feature Engineering: New features might be created from existing ones to improve model performance.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical features are converted into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Scaling: The data is scaled using standardization (StandardScaler) to ensure that features are on a similar scale, which is crucial for certain machine learning algorithms.
5. Splitting the Data
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used for evaluation.
6. Model Selection and Training
Choosing the Algorithm: The notebook chooses an appropriate machine learning algorithm, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
Training the Model: The chosen algorithm is trained using the training data (model.fit(X_train, y_train)).
7. Model Evaluation
Predictions: The model makes predictions on the test data (model.predict(X_test)).
Performance Metrics: Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, or accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The metrics help in understanding how well the model has generalized to unseen data.
8. Visualization of Results
The results, such as actual vs predicted values, are visualized using plots like scatter plots or line plots. This helps in understanding the modelâ€™s performance visually.
9. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)
If necessary, hyperparameter tuning might be performed using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best parameters for the model.
10. Model Deployment (Optional)
After achieving satisfactory performance, the model can be saved using joblib or pickle for future use in predictions or deployment in a production environment.
